    "What is `venv`?\n",
    "\n",
    "`venv` is a lightweight module for managing `Python` virtual environments. This allows you to manage seperate package version for different projects. When creating a new project, you can simply create a new virtual environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why use `venv`?\n",
    "\n",
    "By creating and managing seperate environemnts for different projects,  there is no chance of breaking currenty installed packages in other environments. It is very similiar in nature to `conda`, but it was made specific for to be used with python. It also helps with reproducability among developers and researchers working on large projects.  \n",

    "- The full official documentation for `venv` can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)\n",

    "If you are looking for practical exmaples, I recommend consulting the user guide; however, if you are looking for more information about specific details of `venv`, I recommend consulting the full documentation."
