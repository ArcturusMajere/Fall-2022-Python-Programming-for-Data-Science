A *relational database* is a database that stores related information across multiple tables, and allows to query information in more than one table at the same time. Within a table, the data is organized in a tabular format with rows and columns.Database Management System (DBMS) is sftware used to manage a digital databas.\n","\n","SQL was initially developed in 1970, and since then different companies and vendors implemented SQL in their products with some variations. To bring greater conformity, the American Standards Institute (ANSI) published the first SQL standard in 1986. The standards has been updated every fews year since then. \n","\n","Today, there are several variants of SQL for database management systems available, such as those developed by companies such as IBM Db2 and Oracle Database, as well as variancts developed by communities, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc. Although these variants have certain differences, they are based on the basic SQL syntax, and are similar. \n","\n","Advantages of SQL include: standardized syntax (all relational database systems have an SQL query interpreter built in), and easy-to-understand with English-like commands and functions. \n","\n","SQL is a very important tool for data scientists, data analysts, developers, and database administrators. \n","\n","### SQLite\n","\n","In this lecture, we wil use SQLite that implements a self-contained, serverless SQL database engine. SQLite is the most widely deployed database engine. Unlike most other SQL databases, SQLite does not have a separate server process, and it reads and writes directly to disk files, which contain complete SQL databases with multiple tables is contained in a single disk file. However, because it has no server managing access to it, it fails in multiuser environments where multiple people can simultaneously edit the SQLite file.\n","\n","\n","### SQL versus Pandas"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<a name='section2'></a>\n","\n","# 24.2 Using SQLite with Python\n","\n","To demonstrate the use of SQLite with Python, in this lecture we will use *magic commands* in Jupyter Notebook. Magic commands are special commands which are not valid code, but perform certain actions in a Jupyter Notebook. They beging with the `%` symbol, as in the popular command `%matplotlib inline`, which renders Matplotlib figures in the cells' output. Magic commands that begin with `%%` affect only the current cell. \n","\n","\n","The library `ipython-sql` offers the magic functions `%sql` and `%%sql`, which allow to connect to a database and use standard SQL commands in Jupyter Notebooks. If we run the notebooks on Google Colab, `ipython-sql` comes preinstalled. And, if you run it on your computer, it ca be installed by `pip install ipython-sql`.  \n","\n","\n","To lead the `ipython-sql` library we can use `%load_ext sql` as in the next code. In this line, `%load_ext` is a magic command that loads an external package that can add new magic commands.
