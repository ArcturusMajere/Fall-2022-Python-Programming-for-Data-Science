    "Functional programming may be preferable when working with many data operations and few objects (e.g., a relatively small number of variables). In contrast, OOP often works better when there are many objects but relatively few operations. Keep in mind that both often get the job done, and that many programming languages incorporate elements of both.\n",

On the other hand, list comprehensions are often faster than the functional tools, as well as NumPy functions are typically superior for array operations. "

    "\n",
    "- To replace the unnecessary use of classes. For instance, we have a class that contains just one method besides the `__init__()` constructor method. In such cases, it is often preferred to use a closure instead of a class.\n",
    "- To avoid the use of the global scope. If we have global variables used by only one function in the program, closure is preferred. That is, define the variables in the outer function, and use them in the inner function.\n",
    "- To implement data hiding and name clashing, since the only way to access the inner function is by calling it, and there is no other way to access the inner function directly.\n",
    "- To remember a function environment even after it completes its execution. We can then access the variables of this environment later in the program."
