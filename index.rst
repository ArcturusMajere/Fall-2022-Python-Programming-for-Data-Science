Course Description
==================

With the increased use of data science projects for improving various
functions and operations across organizations, the tools for managing
such projects have matured as well. This course introduces students to
Python tools and libraries that are commonly used by organizations for
management of the different phases in the life cycle of data science
projects. The content is divided into four main themes. The first theme
reviews the basics of Python programming and extends it with advanced
concepts. The second theme focuses on data engineering, and covers
Python tools for data collection and exploration. The next theme
overviews model engineering, and includes model design, training,
testing, optimization, and packaging. The last theme introduces Data
Science Operations (DSOps), and covers techniques for model serving,
performance monitoring, diagnosis, and reproducibility of data science
projects deployed in production.

Learning Outcomes
=================

Upon the completion of the course, the students should demonstrate the
ability to: 1. Understand and describe commonly used Python frameworks
for life cycle management of data science projects. 2. Apply advanced
Python tools for data collection, analysis, and visualization. 3.
Design, validate, and justify the selection of data science models using
statistical approaches, data mining, and machine learning methods. 4.
Implement algorithms for image and natural language processing using
Python-based frameworks. 5. Understand the main characteristics of
existing Python libraries for deployment, continuous integration, and
monitoring of data science projects. 6. Deploy data science models on
cloud servers and edge devices.
